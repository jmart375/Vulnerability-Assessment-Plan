## Scope Definition
In order to conduct a successful vulnerability assessment, it is imperative to establish a clear and concise definition of its scope and limitations. This will ensure that all pertinent areas are addressed and any potential vulnerabilities are accounted for. Our assessment will utilize Nessus, a widely recognized tool for vulnerability scanning. The scan will be tailored to include all identified systems, networks, applications, and infrastructure components within the specified scope. We will use the latest vulnerability signatures and best practices provided by Nessus to conduct a comprehensive assessment. By accurately identifying assets and properly delimiting the scope, we can ensure a thorough vulnerability assessment that covers all relevant areas. Using Nessus will facilitate efficient scanning and identification of vulnerabilities, providing valuable insights to enhance the organization's overall security posture.

## Establishing Assessment Criteria
To conduct a thorough and effective vulnerability assessment, it is essential to establish a set of assessment criteria. These criteria serve as a baseline for evaluating vulnerabilities and determining their severity level. The assessment criteria should align with industry best practices, compliance requirements, and established security standards. The following factors should be considered when defining the assessment criteria:
- Industry Best Practices: Incorporate widely recognized and accepted security best practices specific to the organization’s industry. This ensures that the assessment aligns with the most current security recommendations.
- Compliance Requirements: Consider any regulatory or legal requirements applicable to the organization. Compliance frameworks such as ISO 27001, NIST, PCI-DSS, or HIPAA may provide specific guidelines for vulnerability assessments that must be followed.
- Security Standards: Refer to established security standards and frameworks such as the CIS Controls or the OWASP Top Ten to guide the assessment process. These standards outline common vulnerabilities and guide how to assess and mitigate them effectively.
- Risk Assessment: Consider the potential impact and likelihood of exploitation for each identified vulnerability. Consider factors such as the sensitivity of the asset, the potential harm or loss associated with an exploit, and the likelihood of an attacker successfully exploiting the vulnerability.

The vulnerability assessment will be conducted consistently and standardized by establishing assessment criteria based on industry best practices, compliance requirements, and security standards. This ensures that vulnerabilities are evaluated accurately and prioritized effectively, allowing the organization to focus on mitigating the most critical risks.

## Items to Look for when Selecting a Vulnerability Tool
In vulnerability assessment, it is crucial to carefully consider the tools or services that align with your unique objectives and requirements. A diverse array of options exist, ranging from commercially available, like Nessus, to open-source solutions like Greenbone that can effectively scan and identify vulnerabilities within systems and networks. Thus, when investing ample time in selecting the fitting option for Design World’s particular scenario is essential. with the availability of resources, there are a few things to consider when selecting a service to implement. The first thing FMJ2 would consider is the capability to scan DW’s systems and networks to identify vulnerabilities. Next would be DW’s system’s scalability and ensuring the tools and services can handle complex systems without slowing any network traffic. Among many other topics, this last one is vital, which deals with the cost of the vulnerability tool that has to fit the assessment budget.

## Scanning Schedule for Optimal Outcomes
In order to optimize the effectiveness of vulnerability scans, it is advisable to establish a scanning schedule that reflects the organization’s operational requirements, and the potential impact of scans on systems. This entails assessing the frequency and timing of vulnerability scans, both regular and additional scans, after significant environmental changes. Our team will collaborate with DW to establish an agreed-upon scanning schedule and ensure adherence. Additionally, supplementary scans will be conducted after substantial modifications are made to DW's system and network to ensure no vulnerabilities have been overlooked. It is imperative to conduct scans after any incidents or breaches to prevent the recurrence of similar attacks.

## Permissions from the Client
To perform a comprehensive vulnerability assessment, it is imperative to possess the requisite permissions, credentials, and access. Collaborating with relevant stakeholders and securing necessary authorizations or agreements is strongly advised. Additionally, it is critical to incorporate a detailed plan for access and authorization into the assessment process.
