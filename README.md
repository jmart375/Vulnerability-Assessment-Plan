# Vulnerability Assessment Plan and Final Vulnerability Assessment Plan

The next logical step was to conduct a Vulnerability Assessment Report or Vulnerability Analysis, which played a crucial role in identifying weaknesses and security issues within DWâ€™s cloud environment. This plan outlined the methodology for identifying weaknesses in DW. The team utilized both automated scanning tools, such as Nessus, and manual testing to pinpoint vulnerabilities of varying severity levels. The vulnerability assessment report documented the findings, presenting a comprehensive list of identified vulnerabilities. 

This report also outlines the vulnerabilities discovered and recommends mitigations to enhance the security of the organization. The FMJ2 Net Shield Team conducted network-based scans on selected subnets (172.16.102.0/24 and 172.16.120.0/24) to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities. The report focused on CentOS, Domain Controller, Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Windows hosts. The team expected to find minimal vulnerabilities but there were a lot of critical and high risk vulnerabilities. The team then needed to go in and validate the vulnerabilities in the system. The following sections below provide a summary of the vulnerabilities found and mitigations to address these issues effectively.
